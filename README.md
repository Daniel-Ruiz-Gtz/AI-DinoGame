# Project Artificial Intelligence Seminar 2 Dino

A free topic project to demonstrate what we have learned in the Artificial Intelligence Seminar 2 class, where an AI learns to play the Dino game.

## Introduction 🚀
Our final project consists of implementing neural networks to enable an AI to play the famous Google Chrome dinosaur game. <br>
For this purpose, we used a multi-layer neural network with 7 neurons in the input layer. This number was not chosen randomly; the main reason for this architecture is that each neuron handles a value related to the game. Below is a diagram of the architecture, along with the value each neuron handles.

## Running the Project 🚘
To run the project, you only need Python. If you don't have it, go to the official <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python website</a> to download and install it. Once Python is installed and verified to be working correctly, you need to download the necessary modules to run the program:
```
pip install pygame
pip install neat-python   
```
Finally, you just need to run the following command within the project folder:
```
python main.py   
```
